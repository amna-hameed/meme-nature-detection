Meme Detection System

Project Description:

You are required to work on the provided meme’s dataset. The dataset consists of two types of
data. i.e., images and text.
Sentiment Classification: Given an Internet meme, the first task is to classify it as a positive, very
positive, negative, very negative or neutral meme.
• Train any 6 classifiers (3 for images and 3 for text) on the provided dataset using sklearn
library. Classifiers can be of your own choice. You have to do the majority voting on the
basis of labels returned by classifiers.
• Display the confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision and F1-meausre for the 5
classifiers you have trained.
• Now comes the most important part of the project, you will be working with Flask in this
project. Flask is a Python web framework that makes it easy to create a fully featured web
application. It is quite simple, easy to learn and is a very demanding skill in the market thus
will help you a lot.

• You have to create a web application and deploy your project on it, basically interacting
on the web application for input and output. A user will be giving the test case on your
website e.g., giving some meme and you have to tell that whether it is positive or negative.
• You’re encouraged to push your creative skills and create a user-friendly web application
as the aesthetics and presentation of the web application carries some portion of the
project’s marks.
• Start working right away as the deadline of the project is final and will not be extended.
